# traffic-light-electronics-simulation
This project simulates a traffic light system using digital logic ICs in Tinkercad. A function generator provides clock pulses to a 74HC74 flip-flop, and logic is implemented using a 74HC02 NOR gate. The sequential outputs control red, yellow, and green LEDs without using a microcontroller.
